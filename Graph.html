            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h2>
    
            <h4 style="text-align: left;">The first two editions of the Ranking Framework successfully provided insight into the scale and scope 
            <br>of State-driven initiatives and enabled mutual learning amongst ecosystem stakeholders. 
            <br>Startup Ranking Framework 2019 was formulated as a result of key learnings from the 
            <br>first edition and numerous good practices identified.

            <br><br>States’ Startup Ranking Framework 2020 is an evolved evaluation tool aimed to strengthen the support 
            <br>of States and UTs to holistically build their startup ecosystems. Startup Ranking Framework 2020 has
            <br>been developed as a more robust and outcome-oriented exercise and aims to achieve large scale progress
            <br> across each State and UT.The distinguishing factor in this year’s Ranking framework is that 
            <br>categories are developed on the basis of population of States. 
            <br><br>The categorization aims to:
            <i>Bring uniformity in the evaluation process and</i>
            <br><br><i>Bring all the States/UTs on a level-playing field</i></h4>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">The graph here gives an idea of business rate in states all over India</h2>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;" >The States’ Startup Ranking Framework 2020 is spread
        across 7 areas of intervention with a total of 26 action points,as compared to the 30 action points in the previous State Ranking Framework. 
        The framework provides guidelines to support implementation of action points along with good practices and evaluation metrics. 
        The consideration period (the period in which compliance and progress on action points will be considered for the evaluation process)
        for the States’ Startup Ranking Exercise is made from 1 st October 2019 to 31 st July 2021.
        In this edition, the timelines have been created keeping in mind the impact of COVID-19 and thus provides a longer span 
        of time to evaluate the efforts of States.</h3>
